# JumpNRun

This project is a basic **JumpNRun** game with a **level editor** programmed for the lecture **Software Engineering** at the University of Applied Science Konstanz, Germany.

### It implements the following programming methods: 
* test driven development with JUnit
* layered architecture (view, controller, model)
* software design patterns
* components and interfaces
* google guice
* logging with Log4J

The first user interface is a TUI, which can also be used parallel to the GUI.
The TUI was used to test the collision methods in an early stage.
